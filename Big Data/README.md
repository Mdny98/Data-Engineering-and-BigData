# Big Data Projects

Welcome to my Big Data Projects repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing hands-on projects and exercises I've worked on in the field of Big Data. These projects reflect both my academic experience and personal exploration in this rapidly evolving area.

## 📘 Background

My journey into Big Data began during the **Big Data course at the University of Tehran**, where I was introduced to fundamental concepts, tools, and technologies widely used in processing and analyzing large-scale datasets. As part of the course, I completed several practical assignments and projects, which are included in the [`UT course`](./UT_course) folder of this repository.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:

- **Course Projects**: Projects and assignments completed during the University of Tehran Big Data course.
- **Independent Projects**: Personal projects developed to deepen my understanding of Big Data tools and techniques.
- **Hands-On Work**: Practical implementations using technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Kafka, and more (depending on the tools used in your projects — update as needed).

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

Some of the technologies used across these projects include (add/remove based on what you actually use):

- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark
- Apache Hive
- Apache Kafka
- HDFS
- MapReduce
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📚 Learning Goals

Through these projects, I aim to:

- Understand the architecture and ecosystem of Big Data systems.
- Gain hands-on experience with distributed data processing.
- Apply data engineering and analytics techniques to real-world scenarios.
